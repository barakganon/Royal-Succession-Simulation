# Current Problems and Unimplemented Code

## Overview
This document outlines the current issues, bugs, and unimplemented features identified in the Royal Succession Simulation game. These items should be addressed in future development iterations to improve the game's functionality and user experience.

## Core System Issues

### Game Manager
- Error handling is inconsistent across different methods
- The AI player controllers are initialized but not fully implemented (`self.ai_controllers = {}`)
- Game state caching mechanism is initialized but not fully utilized throughout the codebase
- The `_generate_character_name()` method uses a very basic algorithm that could be enhanced for more realistic names

### Database Models
- Circular dependencies between models can cause deletion issues (as seen in the `delete_dynasty` route)
- Some relationships have overlapping backref names, requiring manual conflict resolution
- The `PersonDB` model uses string IDs for relationships (`mother_sim_id`, `father_sim_id`, etc.) instead of proper foreign keys

## Unimplemented Features

### Military System
- Naval combat is defined in unit types but not fully implemented in battle mechanics
- Siege mechanics are basic and don't account for wall strength, supplies, or reinforcements
- Unit experience and quality attributes exist but don't significantly affect combat outcomes
- Army formations and tactics are not implemented

### Diplomacy System
- The `negotiate_peace()` function is defined but appears to be outside the `DiplomacySystem` class
- Complex diplomatic actions like espionage and sabotage are mentioned but not fully implemented
- Alliance chains and obligation systems are not implemented
- Diplomatic reputation effects are simplistic

### Economy System
- Resource trading between territories is not fully implemented
- Economic policies beyond basic tax rates are not implemented
- Banking and loans system is referenced but not implemented
- Population dynamics (growth, migration, etc.) are overly simplistic

### Map System
- Pathfinding algorithm exists but doesn't account for terrain difficulty or roads
- Seasonal effects on territories are not implemented
- Natural disasters and events affecting territories are not implemented
- Border disputes and contested territories mechanics are limited

## UI/UX Issues

### Web Interface
- Limited mobile responsiveness
- No tutorial or help system for new players
- Inconsistent styling across different views
- Limited feedback for player actions

### Visualization
- Family tree visualization is basic and may not handle large dynasties well
- Map visualization doesn't show resource distribution
- Battle visualizations are text-only with no graphical representation
- Economic trends are not visualized with charts or graphs

## Technical Debt

### Code Structure
- Some methods are excessively long and could be refactored for better readability
- Inconsistent error handling patterns across different modules
- Duplicate code for similar operations across different systems
- Limited code comments in some complex algorithms

### Performance Concerns
- No pagination for large data sets in the UI
- Database queries are not optimized for large game worlds
- No caching mechanism for frequently accessed data
- Potential memory leaks in long-running game sessions

## Testing Gaps
- Limited unit tests for core game mechanics
- No integration tests for system interactions
- No performance benchmarks for large game worlds
- No automated UI testing

## Conclusion
While the Royal Succession Simulation game has a solid foundation with well-defined systems for dynasty management, military, diplomacy, economy, and map interactions, there are several areas that require further development and refinement. Addressing these issues will significantly improve the game's functionality, user experience, and overall quality.
