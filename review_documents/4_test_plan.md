## Test Environments

### Development Environment
- Local development machines
- SQLite database
- Debug mode enabled
- Mock data for testing

### Staging Environment
- Staging server with similar specs to production
- PostgreSQL database
- Production-like configuration
- Anonymized production data

### Production Environment
- Limited testing on production
- Monitoring and logging
- Canary deployments for new features

## Test Data

### Mock Data
- Generate mock dynasties, characters, and territories
- Create test scenarios for specific features
- Simulate game progression for long-term testing

### Anonymized Production Data
- Use anonymized copies of production data for realistic testing
- Test migration scripts on real-world data
- Analyze performance with actual usage patterns

## Test Automation

### Automated Test Suite
- Unit tests with pytest
- Integration tests with pytest and Flask test client
- UI tests with Selenium or Cypress
- API tests with requests or pytest-flask

### Continuous Integration
- Run tests on every pull request
- Run full test suite nightly
- Generate test coverage reports
- Enforce minimum test coverage thresholds

## Manual Testing

### Exploratory Testing
- Free-form testing to discover unexpected issues
- Focus on user experience and game feel
- Test edge cases and unusual scenarios

### User Acceptance Testing
- Involve actual users in testing
- Collect feedback on usability and enjoyment
- Identify pain points and areas for improvement

### Regression Testing
- Test critical paths after major changes
- Ensure fixed bugs don't reappear
- Verify core functionality remains intact

## Bug Tracking and Resolution

### Bug Reporting
- Use a structured bug reporting template
- Include steps to reproduce
- Document expected vs. actual behavior
- Attach screenshots or logs when applicable

### Bug Prioritization
- Critical: Game-breaking issues affecting all users
- High: Major functionality broken for many users
- Medium: Features partially broken or affecting some users
- Low: Minor issues, cosmetic problems, or edge cases

### Bug Resolution Process
1. Bug reported and documented
2. Bug triaged and assigned
3. Developer fixes the issue
4. Tests written to prevent regression
5. Code reviewed and merged
6. Verified in staging environment
7. Deployed to production
8. Closed after verification
